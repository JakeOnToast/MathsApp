## Background

I spent about a month working on this project between finishing my job at Afon technology and starting my degree at the University of Bath. I wanted to experiment with custom widgets, NoSQL, Firebase and mobile ads. I never got around to fully implementing all of the topics or publishing the app but I did get a working example for the addition category.
